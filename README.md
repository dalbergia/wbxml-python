# wbxml-python
Generic Python WBXML decoder based on PyWBXMLDecoder

This is a generic WBXML decoder for Python, based on David Shaw's ActiveSync WBXML decoder
at https://github.com/davidpshaw/PyWBXMLDecoder . The intent of this package is to provide
a feature-complete and extensible WBXML decoder for all valid WBXML codespaces.
